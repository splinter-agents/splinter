description: Make multiple agents work together without stepping on each other

# Coordination Layer

The Coordination Layer makes agents behave like a system, not independent scripts.

## Why Coordination?

Without coordination, agents will:
- Overwrite each other's work
- Lose progress on failures
- Pass invalid data between steps
- Not know what other agents are doing

## Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| [Shared State](/coordination/shared-state) | Single source of truth |
| [State Ownership](/coordination/state-ownership) | Who can write what |
| [Checkpointing](/coordination/checkpointing) | Save/resume progress |
| [Schema Validation](/coordination/schema-validation) | Validate outputs |
| [Chain Awareness](/coordination/chain-awareness) | Agents know history |
| [Goal Tracking](/coordination/goal-tracking) | Track progress |
| [Action Eligibility](/coordination/action-eligibility) | Who can act when |
| [Completion Signals](/coordination/completion-signals) | Explicit done |
| [Wait Tracking](/coordination/wait-tracking) | Why is agent idle? |

## Quick Example

```python
from splinter.coordination import (
    SharedState,
    StateOwnershipManager,
    CheckpointManager,
    ChainContext,
    GoalTracker,
)

# Shared state
state = SharedState(initial_data={"topic": "AI"})

# Ownership rules
ownership = StateOwnershipManager()
ownership.register_ownership("researcher", ["research.*"])
ownership.register_ownership("writer", ["content.*"])

# Checkpointing
checkpoints = CheckpointManager()

# Chain awareness
context = ChainContext(workflow_id="wf-123")
context.register_agent("researcher", role="Research topics")
context.register_agent("writer", role="Write content")

# Goal tracking
goals = GoalTracker()
goals.set_goal(Goal(
    goal_id="main",
    description="Write a blog post",
    success_criteria=["Research", "Draft", "Review"],
))
```

## The Flow

```
Agent A completes
    │
    ▼
├─ Update shared state (with ownership check)
├─ Validate output schema
├─ Create checkpoint
├─ Update goal progress
├─ Signal completion
    │
    ▼
Agent B starts
    │
    ▼
├─ Check eligibility
├─ Get chain context (history, other agents)
├─ Read shared state
├─ Execute...
```
